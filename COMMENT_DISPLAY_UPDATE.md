## 🎯 How It Works

### **For YouTube Analysis:**
```javascript
// Harassment comments include text
{
  author: "@user123",
  text: "You're so ugly...",
  severity: "high",
  time: "2 hours ago"
}

// Converted to flagged account
{
  handle: "@user123",
  platform: "YouTube",
  risk: "High",
  comment: "You're so ugly...",  // ← Added
  lastSeen: "2 hours ago"
}
```

### **For Demo Analysis:**
```javascript
// Demo harassment comments
{
  author: "pro_gamer_2024",
  text: "Fat loser, go away",
  type: "harassment"
}

// Converted to flagged account
{
  handle: "pro_gamer_2024",
  platform: "YouTube",
  risk: "High",
  comment: "Fat loser, go away",  // ← Added
  lastSeen: "5 minutes ago"
}
```

## 📊 Display Rules

### **Truncation:**
- Comment > 100 chars → Show first 100 + "..."
- Comment ≤ 100 chars → Show full text
- No comment → Show "-"

### **Tooltip:**
- Hover over comment → See full text
- Uses HTML `title` attribute
- Works for long comments

### **Styling:**
```css
max-width: 300px;
overflow: hidden;
text-overflow: ellipsis;
white-space: nowrap;
```

## 🔒 Security Features

### **HTML Escaping:**
```javascript
function escapeHtml(text) {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  div.textContent = text;
  return div.innerHTML;
}
```
